<h1>Consent for participants</h1>
<p>You are being invited to participate in a research study titled The Big Car Count. This study is being led by <a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/964/dr-malcolm-morgan">Dr Malcolm Morgan</a> from the University of Leeds.</p> 
<p>The purpose of this research study is to gather information on how parking provision and car use varies across the UK. Researchers know a lot about every vehicle in the UK such as its physical characteristics, emissions, and its MOT history. However, because we don't know the location of vehicles we can't answer simple questions such as are vehicles in Leeds older than vehicles in London? Or, do people in clean air zones drive less polluting cars? Or do people in less affluent neighbourhoods drive cheaper to run cars? By conducting a survey of parked vehicles, we can gain insights into the differences in the vehicle fleet across the country.</p>
<p>You can contribute to our research using this web app. We are interested in the locations of vehicles (cars/vans/motorbikes) parked in their “home” locations. I.e. where they spend the night. To complete the survey type in the number plate of a parked vehicle and click the button that best describes where it is parked.</p> 
<p>You can contribute a many observations as you wish, but it is most useful when people survey a whole street which takes around 15 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw from the survey at any time.</p>
<p>Contributing to the survey is anonymous no personal data about you or your device is included in the survey responses. A random device ID is associated with your submissions, which we use to detect duplicate and erroneous submissions. You can erase your device ID at any time by deleting your browser cookies. Please note that the web app will also record the time and location of any submissions, and the app will ask for permission to access location information.</p>
<p>If you wish to participate in the prize draw for participants, you will have the option to register an email address with your device ID. Email addresses will be held securely at the University of Leeds until the prize draw has been completed (31st December 2024) and will then be deleted. We will not use your email for any other purpose that the prize draw or share it with anybody else.</p>
<p>There are no serious risks associated with this research study; however, you should be aware of these possible risks:</p>
<p>Participating in this survey involves walking in public places. It is your responsibility to ensure your own safety while walking in the street. Please take care to avoid trips, or accidents while crossing the road. If you are going into an unfamiliar area, we recommend that you go with a friend or let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back. Do not participate in the survey if you feel unsafe.</p>
<p>While conducting this survey you may encounter questions from members of the public about what you are doing. If this happens we suggest you explain that you are participating in a university parking survey, and that no personal data is being gathered. If a member of the public asks you not to include their vehicle or street in the survey you should respect their wishes and leave.</p>
<p>As with any online related activity the risk of a data breach is always possible. This web app does not collect any personal data about you or your device. But it does collect the time and location of your device when you submit an observation. Which could be linked to your email if you chose to register. We will minimise any risks by storing data securely and deleting personal data as soon as possible. Further information is available via the University of Leeds <a href="https://dataprotection.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2019/02/Research-Privacy-Notice.pdf">Privacy Notice</a>.</p> 
<p>By participating in this survey you are accepting that we may retain, use, and publish anonymised data that you submit, and that you accept the risks outlined above.</p>
